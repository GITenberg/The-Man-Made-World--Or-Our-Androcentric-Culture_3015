description: Early feminist author and advocate Charlotte Perkins Gilman is today
  best remembered for the haunting short story The Yellow Wallpaper, which recounts
  the female protagonist's descent into madness. In addition to her prodigious body
  of fictional work, Gilman wrote a great deal of non-fiction, including scholarly
  and persuasive essays about equality and the female condition. This long-form essay
  details the misogyny that was pervasive in Western culture in the late nineteenth
  and early twentieth centuries.
